Parameters:
Pipeline Design
##Data Preprocessing:

#Filtered features with more than 40% missing values.
#Missing values imputed using the column mean.

##Normalization:

#Row-wise normalization: Divided each row by its median.

#Column-wise Z-score normalization: Standardized each feature across samples.

#Cross-Validation:
Used Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure balanced group distribution between training and testing splits.

#SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique):
Applied to address class imbalance in the training dataset.

##Feature Selection

#MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance):
Selected the top 25 features based on relevance and redundancy minimization.

#Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):
Utilized a Random Forest Classifier to recursively eliminate features and select the top 25 features.

#Common Features:
Features were selected based on the intersection of MRMR, RFE, and the Differentially Expressed Proteins (DEPs) identified in the reference paper.

##Model Training and Evaluation
Support Vector Machine (SVM):

#Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV:
C: [0.1, 1, 10]
kernel: ['linear', 'rbf']
gamma: ['scale', 'auto']
Random Forest Classifier:

#Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV:
n_estimators: [50, 100]
max_depth: [None, 10]
min_samples_split: [2, 5]
min_samples_leaf: [1, 2]
