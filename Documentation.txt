Project Architecture:
- Data Loading and Preprocessing:
  - Protein expression data is loaded from the research paper’s dataset.
  - Missing values are handled by column-wise mean imputation.
  - Features with more than 40% missing values are dropped.
  - Normalization is performed:
    - Row-wise normalization: Each row is divided by its median.
    - Column-wise Z-score normalization: Features are standardized across samples.
  
- Feature Selection:
  - MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) is used to select features based on relevance to the target and redundancy minimization.
  - RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) selects features recursively using a Random Forest Classifier.
  - The final feature set is determined by the intersection of MRMR, RFE, and DEPs (Differentially Expressed Proteins) identified in the reference paper.

- Cross-Validation:
  - Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation is used to split the data into balanced training and testing sets.

- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique):
  - Synthetic samples are generated for the minority class in the training set to address class imbalance.

- Model Training and Evaluation:
  - Two machine learning models, SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated.
  - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV.
  - Evaluation metrics include Accuracy and ROC AUC.
  - ROC Curves are visualized for each cross-validation fold.

- Result Aggregation:
  - Common features across all folds are identified and reported.
  - Mean accuracy and ROC AUC are calculated for each model.

Design Decisions:
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Drop features with missing values in more than 40% of the samples.
  - Impute missing values using the column mean.
  - Apply row-wise median normalization and column-wise Z-score normalization.

- Feature Selection:
  - Select 25 features using MRMR and RFE methods independently.
  - Include features that intersect with DEPs from the reference paper to enhance biological relevance.

- Cross-Validation:
  - Use Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation to maintain balanced classes in training and testing sets.

- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate models based on Accuracy and ROC AUC.
  - Use the cumulative intersection of selected features across folds to identify consistent biomarkers.

Algorithms Used:
- MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance):
  - Selects features based on relevance to the target and minimizes redundancy among features.
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):
  - Recursively eliminates features based on their contribution to the model’s performance.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM):
  - Used with both linear and RBF kernels for classification.
- Random Forest Classifier:
  - Used for classification and feature importance calculation.
